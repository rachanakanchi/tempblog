### 9 misconceptions about sex debunked by sexperts - By Hannah Schneider

There are a lot of misconceptions about sex out there. 
This is a result of a lot of different societal factors — like the fact that only 13 states in the U.S. require their sex ed to be medically accurate, and that there's a lot of shame surrounding open communication about sex. 
There's also sexism, homophobia, and heteronormativity to blame for a lot of myths when it comes to LGBTQ+ sex and women's bodies. 
No one can blame you for not being totally up to date on what's true and what's not.
When I first became sexually active, I had no idea that people with vaginas should pee after intercourse.

### My life in sex: ‘Erectile dysfunction eats away at your confidence’ - By Anonymous
My wife and I have been together for more than 15 years and enjoyed a healthy sex life until I had a vasectomy four years ago, and started suffering from erectile dysfunction. 
My GP prescribed me the blue pills, but all they did was give me a terrible headache.
My marriage became strained; erectile dysfunction takes away more than your sex life – it eats away at your confidence. 
We went to a psychosexual therapist, whom we saw for more than a year and we were put back together, slowly; through intimacy exercises then talk therapy.
Last year, while making love, I started to feel pain in one of my testicles and was eventually diagnosed with chronic epididymitis, 
which I’m told is probably a result of the vasectomy.

### Three things deflate sexual desire - By Kristen Mark

Desire is a pretty elusive construct. It’s complicated. 
Despite its complexity (or perhaps because of it), people almost universally want it and experience it.
One thing I’ve learned about desire in almost a decade of studying the construct is that desire ebbs and flows. 
It can disappear for long periods of time and then return with force. 
Many in long-term relationships know this all too well. 
Sexual desire is not something that remains steady.

### Orgasms - why faking it today could ruin your sex life tomorrow? - By Emine Saner

Yes, yes, yes. It is obvious to women that faking orgasms is relatively common – although many men seem oblivious. 
In a study of 1,683 heterosexual newlyweds, published in the Journal of Sexual Medicine, researchers at Brigham Young University in the US found that 43% of husbands "misperceived" how often their wives climaxed. 
Men consistently experienced orgasm 87% of the time during sex. For women, it was 49% – but 25% of men thought their wives climaxed more.
Lots of women struggle to achieve an orgasm, says Kate Moyle, a psychosexual and couples therapist.

### Do you have Vagina Disconnection? - By Pamela Madsen

I am a sex educator who gets to work with mostly "enlightened women".
Women who are in some way already on their way to empowering their lives and connecting to their sexuality. 
What continues to shock me is the level of discomfort and stark disconnection that so many of these women have with their own vagina and pelvic bowl. 
The lack of acceptance that a woman has for her own vagina and the lack of knowledge about the incredible potential of embodying the creative life force energy these spaces hold, 
continues to disturb me as I encounter this all over the world. 
The practices that I teach are all about leading, guiding and loving women back to this place of empowerment, pleasure and creation in their bodies. 
Once women can reconnect to their bodies, it is a total game changer.
